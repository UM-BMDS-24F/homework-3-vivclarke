Explain script choices 

(i) blast program
	
I chose to use blastp, which is protein blast, based on what I saw when I opened
the human.fa and mouse.fa files. The sequences in these files were not nucleotide
sequences (ATGC) rather protein sequences. Due to this observation, I went with 
blastp as it is designed for comparing amino acid queries against a protein 
database. 

(ii) substitution matrix

A substitution matrix is a table used in bioinformatics to score the likelihood 
of one amino acid being replaced by another during evolution. It helps researchers 
understand how similar or different two protein sequences are. Blast uses the 
BLOSUM matrix by default. We learned in class that "BLOSUM is based on frequency of 
changes in closely conserved, homologous blocks of motifs – the higher the more 
stringent, e.g. BLOSUM80 is biased towards finding motifs that are highly conserved". 
This version of blast uses BLOSUM62 for blastp.  it’s designed for comparing sequences 
that share about 62% similarity- which was previously determined before the program 
was made. 

(iii) choice of parameters

E-value - represents the number of expected hits of similar quality that could occur 
by random chance. I used 0.001 because it is standard and commonly used in protein 
blast searches. 

outfmt - Output Format is the way results are presented after sequence comparison. 
The value I used, 5, corresponds to XML output, which makes the output formatted 
well for parsing (as we saw in class), specifically with Bio.Blast.NCBIXML.parse(). 

db - Database Name. In order to make sure the results are compared properly the 
database needed to be formatted. I made mouse.fa into mouse_d with makeblastdb which
is a blast command.
